flash-game-jam
==============

This was a project worked on for Adobe's first game jam, 10-20-12 in San Francisco. The game is tentatively called 'Startup Suvival' and the concept is a shooter wher you are a startup founder/entrepreneur and you have to keep investors/lawyers and others at bay by pacifying them with tech jargon and acronyms.  These acronyms act not only to give you points but also as modifiers to your shooting abilities, giving you a temporary advantage during the game. Can your startup survive?
